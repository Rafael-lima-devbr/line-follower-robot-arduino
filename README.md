# Line Follower Robot with PD Control

Line follower robot using 5 analog IR sensors and a PD (Proportional + Derivative) controller for real-time trajectory correction. The system includes automatic calibration, sensor normalization, line position calculation, and logic for sharp curves and stopping conditions.

**Status:** Experimental robotics project

## How It Works

**1. Calibration**  
Runs for ~5 seconds on startup. Captures the minimum and maximum values of each sensor to normalize readings across different environments.

**2. Sensor Normalization**  
Raw sensor values are mapped to a 0–100 scale, ensuring more consistent behavior across lighting and surface variations.

**3. Line Position Calculation**  
Weighted average using weights `[-2, -1, 0, 1, 2]`. If the line is lost, the last valid position is used instead of resetting to zero.

**4. PD Control**

```text
error = setpoint (0) - position
output = kp * error + kd * derivative
```

Derivative is calculated using `dt = (now - lasttime) / 1000.0`.

**5. Motor Control**  
Base speed is adjusted by the PD output. A minimum power threshold prevents dead zones. Supports forward and reverse direction.

## Special Logic

| Condition | Behavior |
|---|---|
| Strong left sensors activated | Sharp left curve |
| Strong right sensors activated | Sharp right curve |
| All sensors detect line | Wait briefly; if center sensor is lost → full stop |
